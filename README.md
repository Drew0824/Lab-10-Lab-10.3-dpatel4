# switch and if-else-if statements

Rewrite the program using `if` and `else if` statements (multi-way else-if) rather than a `switch` statement. 

Use a trailing `else` in your new version corresponding to the default case in the switch statement of the original program.

Reminder: The `char` type is used for variables that hold a single character. When using character literals in a program (like `'A'`) the character must be enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes that are used with string literals.
